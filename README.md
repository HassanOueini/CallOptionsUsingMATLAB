# This was an assignment previously done to simulate option prices using different methods

# Firstly is using Monte Carlo simulation 

# Second is using Finite differences 

# PriceTest.m is the file to run both files and compare them directly

# The assignment is done using the following variables:

# S0 is the initial stock price

# K is strike price 

# T is maturity 

# r is the risk free rate

# x is the vector parameters for LVF

# Smax is upper bound of stock price 

# M is the number of stock price differences, or simulated paths

# N is number of time steps
